Collection of Nagios scripts I've written over the time

[**The Nagios Multi-Process Checker Script**](check_multi_procs) is a custom shell script designed to monitor multiple processes on a system using Nagios. It reads configuration files from a specified directory, where each .check file defines a process to monitor, including optional user ownership and warning/critical thresholds for process counts. The script executes checks for each process, aggregates the results, and outputs a combined status and performance data suitable for a single Nagios service check. This allows for simplified monitoring of multiple processes with consolidated reporting in the Nagios interface. [Documentation](check_multi_procs.md).

[**Nagios Multi-Disk Checker Script**](check_multi_disk) is a custom shell script designed to monitor multiple disk partitions and their inode usage on a system using Nagios. It reads configuration entries from a specified file, where each disk partition is defined along with its individual warning and critical thresholds for disk space and inode usage. The script executes checks for each partition, aggregates the results, and outputs a combined status and performance data suitable for a single Nagios service check. This allows for simplified monitoring of multiple disk partitions with consolidated reporting in the Nagios interface. [Documentation](check_multi_disk.md).
